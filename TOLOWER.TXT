ToLower
-------

This is a small program I hacked together to convert all files
in the current directory to lower case. This is usefull when
uploading something to a unix (web) server. 

I had downloaded once a program that did this, but it destroyed 
some files badly and damaged most off the filenames. :( 
So I thought about writing some small tool for myself :)

You may use this for whatever reason you may need it, as long as 
it is legal and not connected to SPAMMING/KILLING or other mindless 
stuff. If you break it, you own both halves. No warranties, no 
garanties, use it at your own risk. Delivered as is. And dont think
you can copy it and spread it as your own work...

v1.0 First version

[09/21/1997] tels@pobox.com


v1.0-r3

[02/10/2021] Restored OS/2-compatibility. But still broken, because the same
             modified file(name) can be processed twice. Modified universal,
             renamed MAKEFILE with lxLite for NMAKE, OS/2 icon added, a new
             clear warning if directory is empty, formatted output, improved
             error messages, exception handling, no embedded debug code, the
             last file shouldn't be displayed more than once, int's replaced
             by portable size_t's, unused lines and/or C++ comments removed,
             processing modified, and recompiled with IBM VAC++ v3.08.
